				How charmingly sweet you sing!<br>
				Oh! let us be married; <br>
				too long we have tarried:<br>
				But what shall we do for a ring?&quot;<br>
				They sailed away, for a year and a day,<br>
				To the land where the bong-tree grows;<br>
				And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,<br>
				With a ring at the end of his nose,<br>
				His nose,<br>
				His nose,<br>
				With a ring at the end of his nose. </p>
			<p>&quot;Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br>
				Your ring?&quot; Said the Piggy, &quot;I will.&quot;<br>
				So they took it away, and were married next day<br>
				By the Turkey who lives on the hill.<br>
				They dined on mince and slices of quince,<br>
				Which they ate with a runcible spoon; </p>
			<p>And hand in hand on the edge of the sand<br>
				They danced by the light of the moon,<br>
				The moon,<br>
				The moon,<br>
				They danced by the light of the moon.</p>

			<p><strong>A Magic Moment I Remember</strong>
			<p><em>A magic moment I remember:<br>
				I raised my eyes and you were there,<br>
				A fleeting vision, the quintessence<br>
				Of all that`s beautiful and rare.<br>
				<br>
				I prey to mute despair and anguish,<br>
				To vain pursuits the world esteems,<br>
				Long did I near your soothing accents,<br>
				Long did your features haunt my dreams.<br>
				<br>
				Time passed. A rebel storm-blast scattered<br>
				The reveries that once were mine<br>
				And I forgot your soothing accents,<br>
				Your features gracefully divine.<br>
				<br>
				In dark days of enforced retirement<br>
				I gazed upon grey skies above<br>
				With no ideals to inspire me,<br>
				No one to cry for, live for, love.<br>
				<br>
				Then came a moment of renaissance,<br>
				I looked up - you again are there,<br>
				A fleeting vision, the quintessence<br>
				Of all that`s beautiful and rare.<br>

		<td  class="noMusic"><p>I am glad that we have gotten to know each other well 
				and that you put up with my antics. It has been a very enjoyable 4ish 
				months with you. You have shown me things that I never knew about both 
				outside and within myself. One thing I really like is the differences 
				in our similarities. We book like reading, but completely different genres 
				and authors. Hmmm, well, those are our only similarities. But there have 
				been so many good memories built too! Talking at Arnie's, ice skating, 
				Jack's rump, cat butt on the face, oatmeal candles, staying up past sunrise, 
				Japanese dinner, Nomi, Edward Lear, a wonderful card, red bows, cards, 
				breakfast suprises, dozens of emails a day at work...</p>
			<p>Oh Meagan, I, I... I think I.....LUNE YOU!!! I can't wait to come back 
				and you crash into me Hobbes style. I have missed your goofy mouth and 
				charming smile, and that laugh that lives in there. Watch out, I will 
				be tickling with extreme disregard for human life, I have 3 months to 
				catch up on. There is so much more to look forward to too. Picnics, runs, 
				horsies, roller skating, you explaining Master and Margarita to me with 
				that wonderful brain you have that can explain all the things I can't. 
				And the silliness! Tee hee. I forget what we were doing, but it was dark 
				and in bed, and you started laughing and when I asked you just said, &quot;This 
				is silliness.&quot; And all the inappropriate laughter. You've got some 
				sort of nifty blend of smarts, inappropriateness, weaknesses, looks, and 
				patience that I haven't seen in anyone else and I want to hold on to that 
				and snuggle up in it and eat the part that tastes like blueberry pancakes 
				for breakfast on a warm porch overlooking a lake while it rains.</p>
			<p>Plus you let me touch your boobies! That isn't the only reason I like 
				you, but you can admit it can be kinda fun, right? I like you for eyes 
				and mouth, brains and words, mannerisms and dreams. I like how you know 
				about 'important' stuff. I like the way you make me feel like I am important 
				and becoming a fuller and better person. I like that you stay in touch 
				with your friends. I don't like your insides. Well, I like the inside 
				of your mouth, and there are some other inside that I reckon are pretty 
				good, but I mostly mean your bloods and joints. Boo to them. But I like 
				how you don't let it get to you (often). And I also like how you put up 
				with my perversions and working sex into everything, like just before. 
				And I like how you call me buster, pumpkin.</p>
			<p>I feel so lucky to know you and am so glad that we met. I have felt that 
				our bond has grown stronger and more meaningful. Whatever we have going 
				on feels wonderful and nifty and good. In a few short months you have 
				become a very important person to me.</p>
			<p>I MISS YOU THIS MANY: 1,276,489,214,543,245,665,481,726,541,872,564!!!!</p>
