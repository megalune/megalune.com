<?xml version="1.0"?>    <about><p>Welcome, salutations, greetings, and hello. So you are interested in illustrated fantasy characters flying around in tights bashing things up eh? Well good news, I've got the poop on what you crave.<br /><br />This is Mythos, an experimental resource dealing with the relationships between different American comic characters, brought to you through the mystical powers of the internet. There are over 80 different characters within this encyclopedia, and it may continue to grow. Each character has a snazzy image, some dirt on who they are, info on other characters they are associated with, and some outside reading to boot, if you are so inclined.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy your experience here. If you are new and feeling confused about what to do, check out the nifty help section located in the menu, or by clicking <a href="asfunction:_parent.xmlButton,Help">these different looking words</a>. Now, go, have some fun, explore the world of people that are mutated, on fire, invisible, robotic, psychotic, despotic, symbiotic, and all sorts of other abnormal freakish powers that we all know and love.</p></about>
