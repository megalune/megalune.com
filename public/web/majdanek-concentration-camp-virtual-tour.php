					<h1>Majdanek Concentration Camp Virtual Tour</h1>
					<p><em>Skills:
						Photograhy, Director, Flash, Photoshop,  VR Worx</em>					</p>
					<p>As part of a college field trip, a group of design students teamed up  with the Majdanek concentration camp museum staff in Lublin, Poland to  create an immersive and interactive virtual tour of the camp that would  serve as both an educational tool and an archive of the concentration  camp as it appears today.</p>
					<p>Working in teams of 3-6, we spent several days photographing the  site, scanning documents, and becoming familiar with the history of the  concentration camp. Due to the small size of the museum, many of the  items in their possession could not be displayed. It was our hope that  by documenting them, we could share them with a larger audience in a  digital medium, where space was not an issue. We also served the  important role of creating a record of parts of the concentration camp  that were beginning to deteriorate due to age, accidents, and nature.</p>
					<p>Using Apple&rsquo;s Quicktime VR technology, our group created a virtual  tour of the concentration camp within a Director environment that would  potentially be used in a kiosk unit. The VR scenes themselves have  graphical elements that relate to the larger interface, such as lines  connecting typography and a camp map with direction pointer. The initial  interface was created in English only, but was multi-language ready.</p>
