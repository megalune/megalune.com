					<p>I was part of a small team responsible for creating a new design and updating all the content on the company website. The site is fully responsive and ties into an in-house CMS. It displays different content depending on the visitor's location. One of my primary responsibilities was to focus on accessibility for visitors using screen readers. To that end, the site makes use of HTML 5 elements and WAI-ARIA techniques.</p>
