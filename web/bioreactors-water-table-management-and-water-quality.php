					<h1>Bioreactors, Water Table Management, and Water Quality</h1>
					<p><em>Skills:
						HTML, CSS, ColdFusion, Photoshop, jQuery</em></p>
					<p><a href="http://web.extension.illinois.edu/bioreactors/" target="_blank">View Site Â»</a> </p>
					<p>The Bioreactors, Water Table Management, and Water Quality is a  simple site with the goal of educating people about controlled drainage  and bioreactors and how they can be used to limit the amount of nutrient  loading into surface water, and to manage soil moisture during drought  conditions.</p>
					<p>I was responsible for creating the design and fully coding this site.  The site is fully responsive and ties into an in-house CMS. Because the  content can be rather dry (pun intended) I tried to make the site  engaging through the use of large imagery, interactive charts, and  simple typography. I was responsible for the Spanish version of the site  as well.</p>
