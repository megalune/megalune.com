					<h1>3000 Miles to the Trials</h1>
					<p><em>Skills:
						HTML, CSS, PHP, Photoshop, Flash,  WordPress</em>					</p>
					<p>This is a freelance project I worked on for a small group of runners  driving from New York to Oregon, filming their misadventures, and hoping  to eventually watch the Track Trials. I was responsible for coming up  with a video blog design, setting up a custom WordPress theme, and  encoding the videos to a suitable format for streaming.</p>
