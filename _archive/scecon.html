					<p>Scecon is a small business that provides management, logistics, and  stage production services. I was responsible for their scenic design  portfolio redesign, branding launch, and maintaining their online  presence.</p>
					<p>A major part of the redesign effort was to increase the visibility of  Scecon&rsquo;s work. The old design had a handful of small photos scattered  about the site. This new design provided a page for each project to  shine with multiple images and the occasional video or 3D Flash  panorama.</p>
