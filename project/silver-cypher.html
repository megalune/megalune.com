					<p>Jon Krech, founder and lead singer of the doom metal band  Silver Cypher is a good friend of mine. We have worked together (not  with music) on designs and web apps for several years now. He&rsquo;s a great  guy and you should check out the site and the music.</p>
					<p>I was responsible for coming up with the design and fully coding the  site. With each new CD the site is re-skinned to coincide with the theme  of the latest album. Seen here is the latest iteration, based off the  2011 CD &lsquo;Existential Realisms&rsquo;. </p>
