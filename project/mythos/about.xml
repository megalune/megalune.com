The theme for our project was simplicity. I wanted to create a simple to use interface that would allow for the viewing and comparison of a large amount of data within a small space. I see this being a useful tool in many fields, such as comparative religion, film study, comparative literature, mythology, network visualization, and many other similar fields. The resulting project is six months of research and development. I hope you enjoy.<br /><br />For more of my work, please visit my <a href="asfunction:exURL,http://www.tpking.com">website</a>.<br /><br /><strong>References</strong><br /><a href="asfunction:exURL,http://www.dccomics.com/">DC Comics</a><br /><a href="asfunction:exURL,http://www.marvel.com/">Marvel Comics</a><br /><a href="asfunction:exURL,http://spider-bob.com/">Spider-Bob's Comic Book Encyclopedia</a><br /><a href="asfunction:exURL,http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/">visualcomplexity</a><br /><a href="asfunction:exURL,http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></p></about>
